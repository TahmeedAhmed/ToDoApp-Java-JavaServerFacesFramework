# ToDoApp-Java-JavaServerFacesFramework
A Java 'To Do' web app, using JSF.

Chosen Framework: Java Server Faces (JSF)

Reasoning: I had a brief read over the 17 frameworks. Some frameworks were web-based app, whilst some were not.
           So i picked out which ones were web-based depending on the description in the given website.
           I assessed the relavant ones, seeing which one is appropriate and simplistic for this simple To Do app.
           JSF seemed simple and quick to learn as it was mainly Java for the back end programming and XHTML for the 
           front end programming. I was already familiar with HTML, so using XHTML would be easy i figured. 
           JSF is relatively popular, so there was support and tutorials online for it.
           
Difficulty:  Since i have knoeledge on Java and HTML, using JSF was relatively easy. Adapting to XHTML was not difficult. 
             The only difficulties i faced was initialising the server to run on eclipse and a few other settings. Eventually, 
             i figured it out after researching online. I have uploaded a few pictures of the set up in a doc file. 
             
How to run: Download all files into a local folder. Open project (as a Dynamic Web Project possibly) into an IDE. Ensure a server 
            is set up like TomCat. Run the server and go to localhost:8080/JSFTest on browser (JSFTest was name of my project in my dir).
            IF this doesnt work, check server settings and port number and apply the port number.
